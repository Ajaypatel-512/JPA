## Introduction

This repository serves as a playground for learning and experimenting with Java Persistence API (JPA). JPA is a powerful and widely-used technology in Java EE and Jakarta EE ecosystems for managing and persisting Java objects in a relational database.

Whether you're new to JPA or looking to brush up your skills, you'll find various code examples and exercises that cover key JPA concepts and features.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with JPA support (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
- A compatible relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2)

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jpa-learning-practice.git
